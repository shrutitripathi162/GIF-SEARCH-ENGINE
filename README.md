<h1>GIF_search_engine :octocat:</h1>
<h2> Frontend - </h2>
A gif search engine using Giphy API.
Technologies used are HTML, CSS and Javascipt. Data format for handling data during request - json (for obvious reasons).
You can obviously fork this project and add more animations such as scss and make it beautiful.

<h2> PWA (Progessive Web App) - </h2>
I have also added PWA feauture to this project. I thought of doing so as I consider PWA to be prominent technology emerging in the field of mobile app develpment. This statement is with respect to 2020 ;)
